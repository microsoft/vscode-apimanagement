@azure You're going to help me draft an Azure API Management policy. I'll describe what I need, and you'll help create the appropriate policy XML. Use the examples in MS Learn when drafting the policies to avoid errors in the generated policy file.

IMPORTANT: Wait for me to describe my requirements before providing a policy draft.

Below is a reference of available policy elements and their descriptions:
```
${policies}
```

When I describe my requirements, please:
1. Ask clarifying questions if needed
2. Suggest the appropriate policy elements to use
3. Provide a complete policy XML document with comments explaining the logic
4. Keep the drafted policy as simple as possible
5. Add any tips or best practices relevant to my scenario

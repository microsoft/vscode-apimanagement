@azure Below is an APIM policy file. Explain what the policies do. If any of the `inbound`, `backend`, `outbound` or `on-error` element is empty or only contains a base policy, skip explaining it. If the policy contains C# code block, breifly summarize what the C# code block do instead of explaining the code line by line.

@azure Below is an Azure API Management (APIM) policy file. Please analyze it and provide:

1. A brief overview of the policy's overall purpose and what API scenario it likely addresses
2. An explanation of each significant policy element and its function
3. For each section (`inbound`, `backend`, `outbound`, and `on-error`):
   - Explain the flow of policies within each section and their combined effect
   - Skip explaining sections that are empty or only contain base policies with no customizations
4. For any C# code blocks, summarize what functionality they implement rather than explaining line-by-line

Use the MS Learn plugin if possible to get latest information for each policy during the explanation.
Please format your response with clear headings and bullet points for readability.

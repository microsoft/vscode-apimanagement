# Azure API Management Extension for Visual Studio Code (Preview)

Use the Azure API Management extension to perform common management operations on your Azure API Management service instances without switching away from Visual Studio Code.

[Azure API Management](https://aka.ms/apimrocks) is a fully managed service that helps customers to securely expose their APIs to external and internal consumers. API Management serves as a facade and a front door for the API implementations and enables their frictionless consumption by developers. Visit [this page](https://aka.ms/apimlove) for more information and resources related to Azure API Management.

## Managing Azure Subscriptions

If you are not signed in to Azure, you will see a "Sign in to Azure..." link. Alternatively, you can select "View->Command Palette" in the VS Code menu, and search for "Azure: Sign In".

If you don't have an Azure Account, you can sign up for one today for free and receive $200 in credits by selecting "Create a Free Azure Account..." or selecting "View->Command Palette" and searching for "Azure: Create an Account".

You may sign out of Azure by selecting "View->Command Palette" and searching for "Azure: Sign Out".

To select which subscriptions show up in the extension's explorer, click on the "Select Subscriptions..." button on any subscription node (indicated by a "filter" icon when you hover over it), or select "View->Command Palette" and search for "Azure: Select Subscriptions". Note that this selection affects all VS Code extensions that support the [Azure Account and Sign-In](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-azure-account) extension.
